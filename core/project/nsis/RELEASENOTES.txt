Thank you for installing digiKam!

We would like to inform you that this port of digiKam under windows is not as stable as the linux version.
DigiKam works mostly fine under windows, but some features are still broken due to some bugs in the underlying KDE libraries.
For example:
 - Sending items to the trash is currently broken:

 - Camera auto detection doesn't work under windows.
